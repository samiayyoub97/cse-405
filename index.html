            I am using HTML5 to talk about my research on PHP.

        <h3>
            I learned that PHP code must start like this:
            <?php 
            ?>
        </h3>
        <h4>
            I researched and learned that to declare variables in PHP you have to use a money sign. An example would be $Name = 'Sami'; to output the declared variable, 
            you must use echo "$Name";
        </h4>
        <h4>
            In order to use a bool, you can declare it as $a_bool = true; 
        </h4>

            For loops in PHP are very similar to for loops in c++. The syntax for it includes: for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
            code to be executed;
            }
            The init counter initializes the loop counter value. The test counter is evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, then the loop keeps going,
            but if it evaluates to FALSE, the loop stops. Increment counter means to increase the loop counter value. 
            I created an example of a for loop in PHP code to show how it would be written.
        </h4>
        ?php
        for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
            echo "The number is: $x";
        }
        >
        <br>
        This php code reads the number 0 and sees if it is less than or equal than 10. If it is true then it increaments to the next number which will be 1. It will
        keep looping until it reaches the end of the statement, which in this case would be 10. For every TRUE statement, it will display "The number is" and it will 
        display the current number. 
        <br>
        PHP is different than HTML because it is dynamic. It is useful when you decalre variables on the website and you want to see those variables change. 
        PHP is also used for server side programming which will interact with databases to retrieve information, storing, email sending, runs.

        For this week, I researched on how to do function in PHP. The syntax for it is:
            function functionName() {
            code to be executed;
            }
        <br>
        An example on how to write a function can include:
            ?php
            function writeMsg() {
                echo "My name is Sami";
            }

            writeMsg();
            ?
        <br> 
        I found out that writing php functions are very similar to writing C++ functions. It uses the same syntax.
